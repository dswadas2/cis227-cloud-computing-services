    <h2>About CIS227-Cloud-Computing-Services</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing represents a transformative shift in IT services, allowing users to access and manage computing resources over the internet rather than through local servers or hardware. This topic covers the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including its definition, evolution, and the various types of cloud services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It also distinguishes between public, private, and hybrid clouds, explaining how each model can be utilized based on organizational needs and preferences.
